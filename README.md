# MSA: Meta-Synthetic Architecture

**Series:** Picyboo Public Research Series  
**Organization:** Picyboo Cybernetics Inc., Research Lab (Canada)

## Overview
Solved: The Memory Problem That Blocks True Artificial General Intelligence

MSA introduces a meta-coordination layer that enforces logical coherence across specialized subsystems, preventing conflicting updates while enabling transfer. Inspired by prefrontal cortex functions, the framework targets stable knowledge accumulation and self-correction across contexts.

**Keywords:** Continual Learning, Catastrophic Forgetting, AGI Architecture, Meta-Learning, Causal Reasoning, Knowledge Consolidation, Coherence Mechanisms, Neurocognitive AI
