# Meta Synthetic Architecture (MSA) Primer

This primer distils the core ideas from the MSA whitepaper into a concise,
implementation-oriented summary.  It is designed to help engineers and
researchers familiarise themselves with the motivation, architectural
components, and operational loops introduced in the paper.

## Motivation

Traditional large models struggle with catastrophic forgetting, context
blindness, and limited self-correction.  The MSA introduces a meta-coordination
layer that supervises specialised subsystems (perception, cognition, memory,
actuation) to maintain logical coherence across time and tasks.

Key goals:

- **Persistent Coherence**: Ensure knowledge remains self-consistent despite
  distribution shifts and novel inputs.
- **Context Management**: Segment experience into meaningful contexts and
  route signals accordingly.
- **Conflict Arbitration**: Detect contradictions and trigger corrective
  workflows before errors propagate.

## Architectural Layers

1. **Subsystems**: Domain-specific modules responsible for perception,
   inference, planning, and memory operations.  They expose lightweight APIs
   (`process`, `propose_update`, etc.) that the meta-layer can orchestrate.
2. **Meta Coordinator**: Tracks subsystem outputs, measures coherence,
   resolves conflicts, and updates a shared knowledge base.
3. **Context Manager**: Maintains active contexts, scores transitions, and
   provides hints to subsystems about relevant priors.
4. **Knowledge Base**: Stores structured facts alongside provenance and
   confidence scores to support traceability.

## Control Loop (simplified)

1. Perception ingests a signal and proposes structured observations.
2. Cognition interprets the observations, referencing the knowledge base for
   priors and emitting hypotheses.
3. Memory integrates the episode, updates traces, and may emit reminders or
   stability signals.
4. The Meta Coordinator aggregates outputs, assesses coherence, and, if
   necessary, initiates reconciliation (e.g., context switches, confidence
   re-weighting, or requests for clarification).

This loop repeats for each task or input stream, forming a self-correcting
process that guards against forgetting while encouraging generalisation.

## Reference Prototype

The `msa_reference` Python package in this repository implements a minimal
version of this loop.  It is intentionally lightweight but mirrors the APIs
from Appendix B of the whitepaper.  Researchers can extend or swap
subsystems to explore richer behaviours while keeping the meta-layer intact.

## Next Steps

- Integrate the prototype with real datasets as described in Appendix C.
- Expand the knowledge base to support symbolic and differentiable storage.
- Introduce active learning policies so the meta-layer can query subsystems
  for clarification when coherence falls below a threshold.

For deeper theoretical context, consult Sections 3â€“6 (architectural
positioning) and 11 (roadmap) of the whitepaper located in `docs/`.
