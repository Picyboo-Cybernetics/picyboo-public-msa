# MSA Research Landscape

The MSA proposal intersects multiple research traditions.  This overview
summarises neighbouring areas, highlights complementarities, and references
sections of the whitepaper for deeper reading.

## Continual Learning

- **Relation**: MSA provides a meta-layer that enforces knowledge stability,
  complementing rehearsal, regularisation, and architectural expansion
  strategies discussed in Appendix E.  The synthetic forgetting benchmark in
  `experiments/` operationalises these ideas.
- **Key Concepts to Explore**: Elastic Weight Consolidation, experience
  replay buffers, modular networks.
- **Whitepaper References**: Sections 2.1, 3.2, Appendix E.1.

## Meta-Learning & Self-Adaptation

- **Relation**: The meta coordinator acts as an adaptive controller, similar
  to meta-learners that optimise inner loops.  Unlike gradient-based approaches,
  MSA emphasises explicit coherence metrics and symbolic knowledge bases.
- **Key Concepts to Explore**: Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML), adaptive
  control, hypernetworks.
- **Whitepaper References**: Sections 3.3, 6.2, Appendix E.2.

## Causal & Neurosymbolic Reasoning

- **Relation**: MSA's knowledge base can encode causal structures and symbolic
  facts, enabling reasoning beyond statistical correlations.  This aligns with
  Appendix D's vocabulary on structural priors and error detection.
- **Key Concepts to Explore**: Causal graphs, abductive reasoning,
  differentiable programming.
- **Whitepaper References**: Sections 4.1, 5.2, Appendix D.

## Safety & Alignment Research

- **Relation**: By monitoring coherence and conflicts, the meta layer can
  implement guardrails that detect misalignment early.  Chapter 7 and Section
  11 outline auditing hooks and escalation policies.
- **Key Concepts to Explore**: Interpretability dashboards, anomaly detection,
  corrective feedback loops.
- **Whitepaper References**: Sections 7.1, 11.4.

## Suggested Roadmap for Collaborators

1. **Prototype Integration**: Connect `msa_reference` to an existing agent or
   model pipeline to evaluate coherence metrics in situ.
2. **Empirical Validation**: Use the `experiments/` folder as a template for
   more realistic benchmarks and publish comparative results.
3. **Tooling & Visualisation**: Build dashboards that surface context switches,
   conflict resolutions, and knowledge base evolution in real time.
4. **Theoretical Work**: Formalise the coherence metrics using information
   theory or category theory, as suggested in Section 11.5.

This landscape can be expanded collaboratively via pull requests that add
further domains, key papers, or implementation references.
